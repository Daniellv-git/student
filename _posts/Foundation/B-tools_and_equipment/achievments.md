## My Achievements
Some of my achievements include the [lesson I made](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/js/variables/)
I also had a really fun time working on the [Connect 4 game](https://rashig-1804.github.io/csse_teamrepo/connect4/)
During my time in computer science, I was able to create a Connect 4 game and build my own lesson on JavaScript variables. The Connect 4 game was a really fun challenge that taught me how to think logically and work as a team. Creating my own lesson was also a great experience because it pushed me to really understand the material so I could explain it to others. Through these projects I learned a lot about how code works and how to break down problems step by step. These achievements helped me grow as a developer and gave me hands on experience building real interactive projects
