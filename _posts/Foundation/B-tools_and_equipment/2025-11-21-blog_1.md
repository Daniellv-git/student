# 🚀 My Tools Journey  
*A beginner’s adventure into GitHub, VSCode, WSL, and running a real website*

Welcome to the story of how a simple idea — “I want a website” — turned into a full hands-on experience with professional development tools.  
This journey taught me GitHub, WSL, VSCode, and how websites actually get built and deployed.

Let’s break it down.

GitHub Pages was the foundation of everything.

I started by:

- Creating my GitHub account  
- Making my first repository  
- Setting up GitHub Pages to host my website  
- Editing the files using VSDev.net, the online version of VSCode  

Every time I updated my code and pushed it, GitHub Pages did something magical:

👉 **It rebuilt my entire website automatically.**

This taught me:

- How version control fits into real projects  
- How updates travel from my editor → GitHub → the live website  
- That static hosting is powerful and easy once you learn the workflow  
- That each commit becomes a real change on a real website  

Seeing my changes publish instantly made everything feel real.

Developing directly on Windows can be messy, so I installed **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** — suddenly I had a full Linux system running inside Windows.

With WSL I could:

- Run Linux commands  
- Test my website locally  
- Use real development tools  
- Preview everything before uploading  

Testing locally became simple — I just opened:
