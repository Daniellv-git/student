# 🚀 My Tools Journey  
*A beginner’s adventure into GitHub, VSCode, WSL, and running a real website*

Welcome to the story of how a simple idea — “I want a website” — turned into a full hands-on experience with professional development tools.  
This journey taught me GitHub, WSL, VSCode, and how websites actually get built and deployed.

Let’s break it down.

## 🧱 GitHub Pages — My Website Builder  

<details>

GitHub Pages was the foundation of everything.

I started by:

- Creating my GitHub account  
- Making my first repository  
- Setting up GitHub Pages to host my website  
- Editing the files using VSDev.net, the online version of VSCode  

Every time I updated my code and pushed it, GitHub Pages did something magical:

👉 **It rebuilt my entire website automatically.**

This taught me:

- How version control fits into real projects  
- How updates travel from my editor → GitHub → the live website  
- That static hosting is powerful and easy once you learn the workflow  
- That each commit becomes a real change on a real website  

Seeing my changes publish instantly made everything feel real.

## 🐧 WSL — Turning Windows Into a Developer Machine

<br>

Developing directly on Windows can be messy, so I installed **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** — suddenly I had a full Linux system running inside Windows.

With WSL I could:

- Run Linux commands  
- Test my website locally  
- Use real development tools  
- Preview everything before uploading  

Testing locally became simple — I just opened:

```
http://localhost:4000
```

> **Milestone unlocked:** Running a real Linux development environment.

## 💻 VSCode — My Coding Headquarters

VSCode quickly became the place where all the real work happened.

I used it to:

- Build my **About Me** page  
- Organize all project files  
- Install helpful extensions  
- Commit and push to GitHub  
- Write and edit this entire blog post  

Some tools I relied on:

| Tool / Feature | Why I Used It |
|----------------|---------------|
| Explorer | Organize folders & files |
| Live Preview | Instantly see Markdown changes |
| Git Panel | Commit + push to GitHub |
| Extensions | Themes, linters, Markdown tools |
| Terminal | Run Jekyll & Linux commands |

VSCode wasn’t just a text editor — it was a complete workspace.

## 🌟 Final Thoughts  

This wasn’t just a school task — it was my introduction to real development.

By the end, I had:

- Built and updated a real website  
- Learned version control  
- Used GitHub Pages for deployment  
- Installed and used WSL like a real developer  
- Built locally using Jekyll  
- Worked daily inside VSCode  

And all of it connected together into one smooth workflow.

**More tools. More coding. More building.  
Onward. 🚀**
