## **Timeline of My Development Tools Journey**

### **1. Setting Up Accounts**
- Created essential online accounts (GitHub, Slack, and others).
- Established good digital hygiene practices to keep personal information safe.
- Began experimenting with online collaboration tools.

### **2. Building a Web Presence with GitHub Pages**
- Set up a personal repository for hosting a website.
- Edited the `_config.yml` file to customize page settings.
- Enabled GitHub Pages to publish the site.
- Used **vsdev.net** to make and test changes live.
- Published my first public-facing website to share projects.

### **3. Choosing an Operating System & Tool Environment**
- Explored different OS options:
  - **WSL** on Windows
  - **macOS** on Apple computers
  - **Linux/KASM** for Chromebook
- Confirmed tool compatibility for coding languages and development tools.
- Learned the basics of Linux commands, scripting, and package installation.

### **4. Working in VS Code (Desktop)**
- Used VS Code to write, run, and debug programs.
- Tested code locally before making commits.
- Synced changes with GitHub repositories.
- Practiced using virtual environments and running local sites.
