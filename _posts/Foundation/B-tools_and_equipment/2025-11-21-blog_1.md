## Github Pages — My Website Builder
I began by creating my GitHub account and setting up my very first repository. After that, I used the VSDev.net online version of VSCode to access my files from the browser and make edits easily. Every time I updated my code, GitHub Pages allowed me to publish those changes directly to my live website. This helped me understand how version control, online editing, and static website hosting all connect together.

## Operating System Setup — WSL on Windows
To make development smoother, I installed WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on my Windows machine. This gave me access to Linux tools inside Windows and allowed me to run local development commands just like a real web server. With WSL, I could preview my website on localhost before uploading anything to GitHub, making it much easier to test changes instantly and work like an actual web developer.

## VSCode — My Coding Workspace
Most of my work was done in Visual Studio Code, where I wrote the code for my About Me page and organized all my project files. VSCode made editing straightforward thanks to its clean interface, extensions, and live previews. I even wrote this entire blog using VSCode, which helped me stay organized and learn how a proper coding environment feels during real development.
